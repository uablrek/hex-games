	<h3>Basic Map</h3>
	<p>The Map is draggable by grab-and-drag, but not scrollable.
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="map-demo.html">Place a marker. Shows coordinates</a></li>
	  <li><a href="drag-demo.html">Drag pre-placed counters. They will snap to hex</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Show Counters (without map)</h3>
	<p>The counter sheets are converted to PNG. Individual counters
	  are cut from these sheets.  The index is very central! Counters
	  are identified by their's index. The counter images have
	  id=`rdtr${i}`.  Counters are draggable</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="units.html?scenario=0">Counters by index</a></li>
	  <li><a href="units.html?scenario=1">Counters by nation</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Basic Save/Restore</h3>
	<p>Save is complicated since scripts may not write to the local
	  file system. But a browser download can be initiated. Restore is
	  done from the json file "test-deployment.json" which must be in
	  the app directory.
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="deployment-demo.html">Deploy Netrals from a draggable box. <b>Save with Shift-S</b></a></li>
	  <li><a href="restore-demo.html">Restore deployment from "test-deployment.json"</a></li>
	</ul>
