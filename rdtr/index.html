	<h3>Map Demos</h3>
	<p>The Map is draggable by grab-and-drag, but not scrollable.
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="map-demo.html">Place a marker. Shows coordinates</a></li>
	  <li><a href="drag-demo.html">Drag pre-placed counters. They will snap to hex</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>RDTR Counters</h3>
	<p>The counter sheets are converted to PNG. Individual counters
	  are cut from these sheets.</p>
	<p>The index is very central! Counters
	  are identified by their's index. The counter images have id=`rdtr${i}`.
