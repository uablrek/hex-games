	<h2>Manually play a scenario</h2>
	<p>No rules enforced nor help with book-keeping (e.g BRP). You
	must do almost everything manually, like compute odds remove
	causalities. Loads from "rdtrSaveData.js" if present in the app
	directory. <b>Save with Shift-S</b>. Copy the downloaded save to
	"rdtrSaveData.js" in the app directory, and reload the page (F5)
	to restore.

	<h2>Demos</h2>
	<p>For developers and curious people</p>
	<h3>Map</h3>
	<p>The Map is draggable by grab-and-drag, but not scrollable.
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="map-demo.html">Place a marker. Shows coordinates</a></li>
	  <li><a href="drag-demo.html">Drag pre-placed counters. They will snap to hex</a></li>
	  <li><a href="map-demo2.html">Test movement algorithm</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Show Counters (without map)</h3>
	<p>The counter sheets are converted to PNG. Individual counters
	  are cut from these sheets.  The index is very central! Counters
	  are identified by their's index. The counter images have
	  id="rdtr#", where "#" is the index.  Counters are draggable</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="units-demo.html?scenario=0">Counters by index</a></li>
	  <li><a href="units-demo.html?scenario=1">Counters by nation</a></li>
	  <li><a href="units-demo.html?scenario=2">Generated counters</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Basic Save/Restore</h3>
	<p>Save is complicated since scripts may not write to the local
	  file system. Instead a browser download is initiated. Restore is
	  done from the json file "test-deployment.json" which is included at
	  build time (please se comments in "restore-demo.js").</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="deployment-demo.html">Deploy Netrals from a draggable box. <b>Save with "s"</b></a></li>
	  <li><a href="restore-demo.html">Restore deployment from "test-deployment.json"</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Sequences</h3>
	<p>RDTR has a lot of sequences. This demo let you step through them
	  without playing</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="seq-demo.html">Hit "Enter" for next step</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Map Maker</h3>
	<p>The Map Maker is a development tool to define properties of
	  hexes on the map</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="map-maker.html">Hit "h" and click on hexes</a></li>
	</ul>
